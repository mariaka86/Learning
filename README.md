This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.2.

## Notes/ Things I learned

* the reason why the styleUrl section under decorators is an array is to give you the ability to apply several css files in your component
* the prefix of your selector(in this case bot) is determined by what short word you selected as a prefix in your angular.json
* modules are used to organixe and group content into self contained modules
* you have to declare components in modules before you use them
